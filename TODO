Current hot, outstanding TODOs:

---

Coderef callbacks require $self of the object calling them.
Otherwise, how do they invoke methods on that object?
I've done a half-baked implementation, but it needs:

	Testing.
	Examples and such modified.
	Document modifications.
	Release Reflex 0.080 since it's a big leap.
	Alert people that the world has changed slightly.

---

Declarative syntactic sugar for collection attributes.
Try to get it into the 0.080 release.

They currently look like this:

	has connections => (
		is      => 'rw',
		isa     => 'Reflex::Collection',
		default => sub { Reflex::Collection->new() },
		handles => { remember_client => "remember" },
	);

Perhaps they should look like this:

	collection connections => (
		handles => { remember_client => "remember" },
	);

That is, the "collection" sub build an attribute that is 'rw', isa
'Reflex::Collection', and instantiates its default value.

Can it instantiate itself lazily?
